     * There are several ways for a web application to receive a client certificate.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * In a typical case, a web application sits behind a reverse proxy and the
     * client certificate used in the mutual TLS connection between the client
     * application and the reverse proxy is passed to the web application via a
     * special HTTP header such as {@code X-Ssl-Cert}. However, it depends on
     * how the reverse proxy is configured.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that there is a specification draft that tries to standardize the
     * name of the HTTP header and the format of its value. The specification
     * is "<a href=
     * "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-cert-field/"
     * >Client-Cert HTTP Header Field: Conveying Client Certificate Information
     * from TLS Terminating Reverse Proxies to Origin Server Applications</a>".
