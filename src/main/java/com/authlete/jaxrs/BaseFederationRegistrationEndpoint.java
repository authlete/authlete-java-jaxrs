/**
 * A base class for the federation registration endpoint of <a href=
 * "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Connect
 * Federation 1&#x002E;0</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * An OpenID Provider that supports the "explicit" client registration defined
 * in <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html"
 * >OpenID Connect Federation 1.0</a> is supposed to provide a federation
 * registration endpoint that accepts explicit client registration requests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The endpoint accepts {@code POST} requests whose {@code Content-Type}
 * is either of the following.
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code application/entity-statement+jwt}
 *   <li>{@code application/trust-chain+json}
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the {@code Content-Type} of a request is
 * {@code application/entity-statement+jwt}, the content of the request is
 * the entity configuration of a relying party that is to be registered.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, when the {@code Content-Type} of a request is
 * {@code application/trust-chain+json}, the content of the request is a
 * JSON array that contains entity statements in JWT format. The sequence
 * of the entity statements composes the trust chain of a relying party
 * that is to be registered.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * On successful registration, the endpoint should return a kind of entity
 * statement (JWT) with the HTTP status code {@code 200 OK} and the content
 * type {@code application/jose}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The discovery document (<a href=
 * "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID Connect
 * Discovery 1.0</a>) should include the {@code federation_registration_endpoint}
 * server metadata that denotes the URL of the federation registration endpoint.
 * </p>
 *
